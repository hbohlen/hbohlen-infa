# Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Learning Curve Overload:** Trying to master Consul, Caddy, Portainer, and Tailscale simultaneously - *Impact: Cognitive overload, incomplete understanding, project delays* - *Mitigation: Focus on one technology per week, use "spike" sessions for exploration*
- **Technology Choice Regrets:** Portainer proves insufficient for complex orchestration needs - *Impact: Need to migrate to Kubernetes mid-project, significant rework* - *Mitigation: Evaluate Kubernetes learning curve early, have migration plan ready*
- **Cost Creep:** Underestimating bandwidth costs for data-intensive services - *Impact: Unexpected monthly bills, budget overruns* - *Mitigation: Set bandwidth monitoring alerts, implement caching strategies*
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Initial configurations prioritize functionality over security - *Impact: Exposed services, potential data breaches* - *Mitigation: Follow security checklists, implement least-privilege access*
- **Vendor Dependency:** Heavy reliance on third-party services (Tailscale, Doppler) creates single points of failure - *Impact: Service disruption if providers change terms or have outages* - *Mitigation: Monitor provider status, have backup networking options*
- **Time Commitment Underestimation:** Infrastructure learning and maintenance might require more time than allocated - *Impact: Burnout, delayed project completion* - *Mitigation: Regular progress reviews, flexible timeline adjustments*

### Open Questions

- What are the operational overheads of Consul vs simpler DNS-based discovery?
- How reliable is Consul's self-healing in network partition scenarios?
- What are Tailscale's limitations for production service communication?
- How does Tailscale performance degrade with 5+ nodes?
- What are the real-world bandwidth costs for typical web services?
- At what point does the hub-spoke architecture become a bottleneck?
- How does Caddy performance scale with 20+ service routes?
