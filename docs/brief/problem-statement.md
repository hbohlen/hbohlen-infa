# Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points:**
The project owner currently maintains multiple VPS instances (Hetzner primary gateway, Digital Ocean service node, with plans for additional VPS) that are managed in isolation. Each VPS requires individual configuration, manual service deployment, and separate networking setup. Personal development services like FalkorDB Browser and custom MCP servers are deployed ad-hoc without unified management, leading to inconsistent configurations and maintenance overhead.

**Impact of the Problem:**
This fragmented approach creates significant operational complexity and learning barriers. Without proper service discovery, automated deployment, and unified networking, scaling personal projects becomes cumbersome. The lack of production-like patterns means valuable learning opportunities are missed, and the infrastructure becomes increasingly difficult to maintain as more services are added. There's also no clear "story" or narrative connecting the various infrastructure components, making it harder to understand the system as a cohesive whole.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Traditional VPS management tools focus on enterprise-scale deployments and are overkill for personal learning projects. Simple hosting solutions lack the educational depth needed to understand production interworkings. Personal cloud platforms are either too abstracted (hiding learning opportunities) or too complex for individual developers wanting to learn infrastructure patterns. Most solutions don't provide the narrative context needed to understand how infrastructure components interconnect and evolve.

**Urgency and Importance:**
As personal projects grow in complexity (adding GraphITI MCP server integration, multiple development databases, and custom services), the current approach becomes unsustainable. Learning production concepts through hands-on implementation is time-sensitive, and establishing proper infrastructure patterns now will prevent technical debt accumulation and enable faster future development. The need for better infrastructure storytelling becomes more critical as the system grows beyond simple VPS management.
