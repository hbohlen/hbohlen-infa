# Epic 4: Multi-Node Container Orchestration

**Epic Goal:** Deploy Portainer across VPS nodes for web-based Docker management, learning distributed container orchestration and resource management without Kubernetes complexity. This epic provides centralized container management capabilities while demonstrating production orchestration patterns at personal infrastructure scale.

### Story 4.1: Portainer Deployment and Multi-Node Setup

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want to deploy Portainer with multi-node container management capabilities,
so that I can centrally manage Docker containers across my distributed VPS infrastructure through a professional web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Portainer server deployed on primary gateway VPS with persistent data storage and backup procedures
2. Portainer agents installed and configured on all VPS nodes (gateway + service nodes) via Tailscale network
3. All nodes visible and manageable through Portainer web interface with proper authentication and access control
4. SSL certificate configured for secure Portainer access via portainer.hbohlen.io through Caddy reverse proxy
5. User access controls configured with appropriate permissions for infrastructure management and learning
6. Basic container lifecycle operations verified (start, stop, restart, logs, stats) across all nodes
7. Portainer backup and recovery procedures documented and tested for operational continuity

### Story 4.2: Service Management and Resource Monitoring

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want comprehensive service management and resource monitoring through Portainer,
so that I can learn container orchestration patterns and operational monitoring for distributed services.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. All existing services (FalkorDB Browser, test services) imported and manageable through Portainer interface
2. Resource monitoring dashboards configured showing CPU, memory, disk, and network usage across nodes
3. Container health monitoring integrated with alerting for service failures and resource exhaustion
4. Service dependency documentation created showing inter-service communication patterns via Tailscale
5. Container log aggregation configured for centralized troubleshooting and operational insight
6. Performance baseline documentation created for resource planning and optimization decisions
7. Service scaling procedures documented and tested through Portainer interface

### Story 4.3: Advanced Container Orchestration and Automation

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want advanced container orchestration features and automation integration,
so that I can learn production container management patterns while maintaining GitOps deployment workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Docker Compose stack deployment configured through Portainer for multi-container service management
2. Container image update automation integrated with GitOps deployment pipeline from Epic 3
3. Environment variable and secrets management configured for secure container configuration
4. Network management configured showing Tailscale integration and inter-service communication
5. Volume management and data persistence patterns documented and implemented for stateful services
6. Container registry integration configured for private image management and deployment
7. Automated service discovery integration prepared for Epic 5 Consul implementation

### Story 4.4: Operations Excellence and Learning Documentation

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want comprehensive operational procedures and educational documentation for container orchestration,
so that I can master container management best practices and share knowledge with other developers.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive troubleshooting runbook created for common container and orchestration issues
2. Capacity planning and resource optimization procedures documented with performance analysis
3. Security best practices documented for container management and multi-node access control
4. Disaster recovery procedures created and tested for complete Portainer and service restoration
5. Container orchestration learning guide created comparing Portainer vs Kubernetes approaches
6. Performance optimization recommendations documented based on actual usage patterns and metrics
7. Knowledge sharing documentation prepared showing container orchestration patterns and lessons learned
