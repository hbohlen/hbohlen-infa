# Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Detailed Budget Breakdown:**
- **Monthly Infrastructure Costs:** €50-100 (Hetzner: €6-8, Digital Ocean: €12-15, domain: €10-15/year)
- **One-time Setup Costs:** €20-70 (VPS configuration, premium support if needed)
- **Ongoing Operational Costs:** €5-30/month (bandwidth, backups, tool upgrades)
- **Weekly Time Commitment:** 10-15 hours technical work, 3-5 hours learning/documentation, 2-3 hours planning/research

**Timeline Breakdown:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Repository setup, VPS configuration, basic service deployment
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Multiple services, automation, performance testing
- **Phase 3 (Months 5-6):** Optimization, monitoring, final documentation

**Technical Skill Requirements:**
- **Current Skills Assumed:** Basic Linux, Docker, Git, networking concepts
- **Skills to Develop:** Advanced Docker Compose, Consul configuration, Caddy setup, Tailscale networking, Infrastructure as Code

### Key Assumptions

- Technology choices (Caddy, Consul, Portainer) will prove suitable for learning production patterns without excessive complexity
- Personal learning pace will allow mastery of core infrastructure concepts within the 6-month timeframe
- VPS providers will maintain stable service levels and pricing
- Open-source tools will continue to be available and supported
- Domain and SSL certificate management will work reliably with chosen infrastructure
- Manual processes can be gradually automated as skills develop
- Community resources and documentation will be sufficient for troubleshooting
- Personal projects will provide adequate real-world testing scenarios

**Assumption Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Caddy's learning curve is manageable for reverse proxy needs
- [ ] Portainer provides sufficient container orchestration for personal use
- [ ] Doppler's free tier meets secrets management requirements
- [ ] Tailscale's free tier supports the planned network topology
- [ ] 10-15 hours/week is sufficient for infrastructure learning and implementation
- [ ] Online documentation and community support will resolve most issues
- [ ] Personal projects will provide adequate testing scenarios
- [ ] VPS providers maintain 99.9% uptime for critical infrastructure
