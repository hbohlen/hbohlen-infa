# Overview

This document defines the integration testing strategy for the hbohlen.io Personal Cloud project. Integration testing validates that components from different epics work together correctly, ensuring end-to-end functionality and preventing breaking changes during the brownfield enhancement process.

## Integration Testing Objectives

- **Validate Cross-Epic Dependencies:** Ensure components from different epics integrate seamlessly
- **Prevent Breaking Changes:** Catch integration issues before they affect production
- **Maintain Service Continuity:** Verify existing services remain functional during enhancements
- **Performance Validation:** Ensure new components don't degrade existing performance
- **Security Verification:** Confirm security measures work across integrated components
