# Epic List

Based on the technical assumptions and staged technology approach, here are the proposed epics that will deliver the hbohlen.io Personal Cloud infrastructure:

**Epic 1: Secure Network Foundation**
Establish Tailscale mesh networking with foundational learning documentation for secure multi-VPS communication patterns and infrastructure-as-code principles.

**Epic 2: Professional Service Access**
Deploy Caddy reverse proxy with domain-based routing (*.hbohlen.io) and SSL automation, demonstrating modern web service access patterns and distributed service routing.

**Epic 3: Automated Service Deployment**
Implement GitOps deployment pipeline triggered by repository changes, teaching CI/CD fundamentals through practical infrastructure automation and version control integration.

**Epic 4: Multi-Node Container Orchestration**
Deploy Portainer across VPS nodes for web-based Docker management, learning distributed container orchestration and resource management without Kubernetes complexity.

**Epic 5: Service Discovery & Health Management**
Introduce Consul for automatic service discovery and health checking, demonstrating production-grade distributed system patterns and operational monitoring.

**Epic 6: Infrastructure Excellence & Knowledge Leadership**
Optimize system performance, create comprehensive portfolio documentation, and prepare knowledge sharing materials for professional demonstration and community learning.

**Epic Structure Rationale:**

This 6-epic approach integrates learning throughout the development process rather than segregating it, ensuring the 70% educational focus is maintained across all phases. Each epic is sized for AI agent execution (2-4 hour focused sessions) while delivering both operational capability and educational insight.

**MVP Boundary:** Epics 1-5 constitute the MVP, delivering all core functionality specified in the project brief. Epic 6 represents post-MVP enhancement focused on optimization and knowledge sharing.

**Progressive Value Delivery:** Each epic builds incrementally on previous functionality while providing standalone value, enabling course correction and technology substitution at epic boundaries if needed.
