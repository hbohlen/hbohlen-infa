# Requirements

### Functional

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
FR1: Implement hub-spoke architecture with primary gateway VPS managing external access and 2-3 spoke nodes handling specific services

FR2: Deploy Tailscale mesh networking for secure, automatic communication between all VPS instances without complex VPN configuration

FR3: Configure Consul service discovery for automatic service registration, health checking, and discovery across all nodes

FR4: Set up Caddy reverse proxy with domain-based routing (*.hbohlen.io subdomains) and automatic SSL certificate management

**Phase 2 (Automation):**
FR5: Deploy Portainer for web-based Docker container management and orchestration across multiple nodes

FR6: Implement GitOps deployment pipeline triggered by repository pushes for automated service deployment and updates

FR7: Create infrastructure monitoring and basic alerting system for core services (Caddy, Consul, Portainer)

**Phase 3 (Operations & Learning):**
FR8: Develop service health checking and automatic recovery mechanisms for critical infrastructure components

FR9: Implement infrastructure visualization dashboard showing service dependencies, health status, and deployment history for educational insight

FR10: Create automated documentation generation that captures configuration changes and deployment patterns

FR11: Develop troubleshooting interface with guided diagnostic workflows for common infrastructure issues

FR12: Establish comprehensive backup and recovery procedures for all infrastructure components and data

### Non Functional

**Performance & Reliability:**
NFR1: Achieve 99.5% uptime for core infrastructure services measured monthly, with planned maintenance windows excluded and automatic failover within 5 minutes

NFR2: Support 10-50 concurrent users with 100-500 requests per minute through optimized container configurations

NFR3: Reduce manual infrastructure maintenance time to under 3 hours per week through automation and monitoring

**Security & Infrastructure:**
NFR4: Maintain secure network communication using Tailscale mesh VPN with automatic key management and access controls

NFR5: Implement automated SSL certificate management and renewal for all domain-based service access points

NFR6: Ensure container resource efficiency with appropriate CPU/memory allocation for learning-focused infrastructure

**Educational & Operational:**
NFR7: Support infrastructure learning workflows with visual service mapping and configuration change tracking

NFR8: Maintain comprehensive documentation of infrastructure patterns and troubleshooting procedures for educational purposes

NFR9: Support horizontal scaling through additional service nodes while maintaining consistent networking and service discovery

NFR10: Maintain cost efficiency within â‚¬50-100/month budget including bandwidth, storage, and service costs
