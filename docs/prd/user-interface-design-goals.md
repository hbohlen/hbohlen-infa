# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The infrastructure management interfaces should provide an "intelligent infrastructure companion" experience that balances educational insight with operational efficiency. Rather than enterprise-grade complexity, the focus is on creating approachable interfaces that make learning infrastructure concepts intuitive while supporting practical management tasks. The experience should progressively reveal complexity as users advance through their learning journey.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive disclosure:** Interfaces start simple and reveal advanced features as users progress through learning phases
- **Educational guidance:** Context-aware help and explanations integrated throughout the interface
- **Visual service topology:** Interactive service maps showing dependencies and health status with learning annotations
- **Tool integration:** Thoughtful integration with existing tools (Portainer, Consul UI) rather than replacement
- **Real-time monitoring:** Live updates focused on learning opportunities and operational awareness

### Core Screens and Views

**Phase 1 (MVP - Foundation Interfaces):**
- **Infrastructure Overview Dashboard:** Simple, centralized view of service health and basic resource utilization
- **Network Topology Map:** Visual representation of service discovery and routing with educational tooltips

**Phase 2 (Automation Interfaces):**
- **Service Management Console:** Integration layer connecting Portainer and Consul interfaces with custom deployment controls
- **Deployment Pipeline Dashboard:** GitOps workflow status, build logs, and deployment history

**Phase 3 (Learning & Optimization Interfaces):**
- **Learning Progress Tracker:** Educational milestones, documentation links, and infrastructure concept guides tied to actual system state
- **Troubleshooting Interface:** Guided diagnostic workflows leveraging actual system configuration
- **Cost and Resource Monitor:** Budget tracking and optimization recommendations based on real usage data

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Basic accessibility compliance focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast for technical interfaces. Priority on making dashboards and monitoring screens accessible during extended infrastructure management sessions.

### Branding
Clean, educational-focused aesthetic inspired by modern learning platforms and technical documentation. Dark theme primary with light theme option, emphasizing readability of both technical data and educational content. Color coding for service health (green/yellow/red) with accompanying icons and text for color-blind accessibility. Professional appearance suitable for learning documentation and potential portfolio demonstration.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop browsers for detailed infrastructure management and learning, with responsive design ensuring monitoring capability on tablets and mobile devices for basic health checks and alerts. All interfaces accessible through modern browsers with emphasis on Chrome/Firefox compatibility for development workflow integration.
