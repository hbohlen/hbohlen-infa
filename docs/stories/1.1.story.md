# Story 1.1: Tailscale Network Setup and Configuration

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Epic 1: Secure Network Foundation

## Story Statement

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want to configure Tailscale mesh networking across my VPS instances,
so that all nodes can communicate securely without complex VPN management or firewall configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tailscale client installed and configured on primary gateway VPS (Hetzner)
2. Tailscale client installed and configured on secondary service node VPS (Digital Ocean)
3. All VPS nodes can ping each other using Tailscale IP addresses
4. SSH access between nodes works through Tailscale network without exposing SSH to public internet
5. Network connectivity verified with basic connectivity tests and documented troubleshooting steps
6. Tailscale node naming convention established (gateway-hetzner, service-do-1, etc.)
7. Basic firewall rules configured to allow only Tailscale and necessary public traffic

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Technical Context from Architecture

#### Tech Stack Requirements
**Infrastructure Foundation:**
- Primary gateway: Hetzner Cloud VPS (cost-effective EU hosting, €8/month)
- Service nodes: DigitalOcean VPS (reliable performance, GitHub Education credits available)
- Mesh networking: Tailscale (zero-trust approach, free tier sufficient)
- Reverse proxy: Caddy v2.7+ (automatic HTTPS, simple configuration)

**Networking & Security:**
- Tailscale: Zero-config mesh VPN for secure inter-VPS communication
- Caddy: Domain routing, SSL termination, load balancing
- Cloudflare DNS: Domain management and DNS optimization

**Container & Orchestration:**
- Docker v24+: Service containerization
- Portainer v2.19+: Multi-node container management
- Consul v1.16+: Service discovery and health checks

#### Project Structure Requirements
**Infrastructure Directory Structure:**
```
infrastructure/
├── docker-compose/               # Service orchestration files
├── caddy/                        # Reverse proxy configurations
├── consul/                       # Service discovery configs
├── monitoring/                   # Enterprise monitoring configurations
└── security/                     # Security configurations
    └── tailscale/                # Mesh network security policies
```

**Scripts Directory:**
- Automation scripts for deployment and configuration
- Setup scripts for initial environment configuration

[Source: docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

#### Testing Strategy
**Testing Integration:**
- Infrastructure validation scripts for network connectivity
- Health check verification for service discovery
- Cross-platform testing with enterprise tools (BrowserStack, LambdaTest)

**Quality Gates:**
- Network connectivity tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Automated validation of Tailscale configuration
- Documentation of troubleshooting procedures

### Project Structure Notes
**Current Discrepancies:**
- Infrastructure directory exists but lacks the comprehensive structure defined in architecture
- Missing: docker-compose/, consul/, monitoring/, security/ subdirectories
- Only present: caddy/ (with Caddyfile.new), docker-compose.isolated.yml
- Need to align project structure with architecture specifications before implementation

**Required Alignment:**
- Create missing infrastructure subdirectories
- Implement proper configuration file organization
- Ensure scripts directory contains network setup automation

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Tailscale free tier limitations appropriately
- Network configuration must support future service discovery integration
- Firewall rules must accommodate planned Caddy reverse proxy setup
- Node naming must be consistent with future multi-node expansion

### Dependencies
- VPS instances must be provisioned and accessible
- SSH access to both Hetzner and DigitalOcean nodes required
- Tailscale account with network access permissions
- Basic system administration tools available on nodes

### Risk Considerations
- Network configuration changes may temporarily disrupt connectivity
- Firewall misconfiguration could lock out access
- Tailscale authentication failures may require manual intervention
- Documentation must be comprehensive for future maintenance

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Network connectivity validation scripts
- Firewall rule verification tests
- Configuration file syntax validation

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end network connectivity between all nodes
- SSH access verification through Tailscale
- Service discovery integration testing (future)

### Performance Testing
- Network latency measurements between nodes
- Bandwidth utilization monitoring
- Connection stability under load

## Success Metrics

- All acceptance criteria verified and documented
- Network connectivity stable and reliable
- Security posture maintained without public SSH exposure
- Documentation comprehensive for future reference
- Foundation established for subsequent infrastructure stories
