# Epic 3: Automated Service Deployment

**Epic Goal:** Implement GitOps deployment pipeline triggered by repository changes, teaching CI/CD fundamentals through practical infrastructure automation and version control integration. This epic transforms manual service deployment into automated workflows that demonstrate modern development and operations practices.

### Story 3.1: Repository Structure and GitOps Foundation

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want to establish a GitOps repository structure with automated deployment triggers,
so that I can learn continuous deployment patterns and version-controlled infrastructure management.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository structure organized for GitOps deployment with services/, infrastructure/, and deployment/ directories
2. GitHub webhooks configured to trigger deployment actions on push to main branch with security validation
3. Basic deployment script created that can deploy containerized services to designated VPS nodes via Tailscale
4. Environment-specific configuration management system implemented with secure credential handling
5. Deployment logging and status tracking configured for troubleshooting and audit trail
6. Git workflow documented for infrastructure changes with manual override procedures for emergencies
7. Rollback procedures documented, tested, and automated for failed deployments with state validation

### Story 3.2: Automated Container Build and Registry Integration

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want automated container image building and registry management with cost and security controls,
so that I can learn modern container CI/CD pipelines while managing resource usage and security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated Docker image builds with resource limits and cost monitoring
2. Container images pushed to GitHub Container Registry with proper tagging strategy and size optimization
3. Image scanning and security validation integrated into build pipeline with vulnerability reporting
4. Multi-stage Dockerfile patterns documented and implemented for minimal image sizes and security
5. Build cache optimization configured to reduce build times and stay within GitHub Actions free tier limits
6. Image versioning strategy documented with automated cleanup policies to prevent storage bloat
7. Cost monitoring and alerting configured for GitHub Actions minutes and Container Registry storage usage

### Story 3.3: Service Deployment Automation and Health Monitoring

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want fully automated service deployment with comprehensive safety measures and health verification,
so that I can learn production deployment patterns while maintaining system stability and learning focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated deployment script with resource management to prevent service conflicts and resource exhaustion
2. Health check verification integrated into deployment process with automated rollback on failure
3. Zero-downtime deployment patterns implemented with manual override capabilities for emergency situations
4. Service discovery integration configured to automatically register new service instances via Caddy configuration updates
5. Deployment notifications configured for success/failure status with detailed logging and troubleshooting context
6. Performance monitoring integrated to track deployment impact with alerts for service degradation
7. Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation created with common failure scenarios and recovery procedures

### Story 3.4: Advanced GitOps Patterns and Operational Excellence

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want advanced GitOps patterns with careful complexity management and comprehensive operational procedures,
so that I can learn enterprise deployment practices while maintaining focus on infrastructure learning objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Simplified environment promotion workflow implemented with clear manual approval gates for complexity management
2. Feature branch deployment capabilities implemented with automatic cleanup to prevent resource bloat
3. Basic automated testing integration configured with time limits to prevent excessive GitHub Actions usage
4. Infrastructure drift detection configured with manual reconciliation procedures to maintain learning control
5. Simple deployment metrics dashboard created focusing on learning insights rather than comprehensive analytics
6. Incident response procedures documented emphasizing learning outcomes and manual recovery options
7. GitOps best practices documentation created with complexity trade-offs analysis and learning pathway recommendations
