# Epic 1: Secure Network Foundation

**Epic Goal:** Establish Tailscale mesh networking with foundational learning documentation for secure multi-VPS communication patterns and infrastructure-as-code principles. This epic creates the secure communication backbone that all subsequent services will rely on, while providing hands-on learning in modern networking approaches and infrastructure automation.

### Story 1.1: Tailscale Network Setup and Configuration

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want to configure Tailscale mesh networking across my VPS instances,
so that all nodes can communicate securely without complex VPN management or firewall configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tailscale client installed and configured on primary gateway VPS (Hetzner)
2. Tailscale client installed and configured on secondary service node VPS (Digital Ocean)
3. All VPS nodes can ping each other using Tailscale IP addresses
4. SSH access between nodes works through Tailscale network without exposing SSH to public internet
5. Network connectivity verified with basic connectivity tests and documented troubleshooting steps
6. Tailscale node naming convention established (gateway-hetzner, service-do-1, etc.)
7. Basic firewall rules configured to allow only Tailscale and necessary public traffic

### Story 1.2: Infrastructure Documentation and Learning Resources

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want comprehensive documentation of the networking setup process and concepts,
so that I can understand the underlying patterns and replicate the setup for future projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Step-by-step Tailscale setup guide created with screenshots and command examples
2. Network topology diagram showing VPS connections and IP address ranges
3. Troubleshooting guide covering common networking issues and resolution steps
4. Comparison document explaining advantages of mesh networking vs traditional VPN approaches
5. Security analysis documenting how Tailscale provides zero-trust networking
6. Command reference sheet for common Tailscale operations (status, ping, logout, etc.)
7. Learning milestone checklist for network infrastructure concepts mastered

### Story 1.3: Infrastructure-as-Code Foundation

As an infrastructure learning developer,
I want version-controlled configuration files for all networking setup,
so that infrastructure changes are tracked and environments can be replicated consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Git repository structure created for infrastructure configurations
2. Tailscale configuration files and setup scripts version controlled
3. Environment-specific configuration templates created for different VPS providers
4. Basic infrastructure validation scripts that verify network connectivity
5. README documentation explaining repository structure and usage patterns
6. Configuration backup and recovery procedures documented and tested
7. Infrastructure change management process established with Git workflow
