# ðŸš€ Development Workflow

### Hybrid Approach: Production-like + Development Speed

â€¢ Production accuracy: Same containers, networks, and service discovery as
production
â€¢ Development speed: Volume mounts, hot reload, fast rebuilds, enhanced logging
â€¢ Best of both worlds: Confidence in deployments + rapid iteration

### Development Commands

# Start local development (production-like with hot reload)
./scripts/dev-start.sh falkordb-browser
# â†’ Available at http://localhost via Caddy
# â†’ Consul UI at http://localhost:8500
# â†’ Hot reload enabled

# Test exactly like production
./scripts/dev-test.sh falkordb-browser
# â†’ Builds production containers locally
# â†’ Tests service registration with Consul
# â†’ Validates routing through Caddy

# Deploy to production
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add falkordb browser"
git push origin main
# â†’ Webhook triggers deployment
# â†’ Available at https://falkordb.hbohlen.io

### Deployment Pipeline

Git Push â†’ Webhook â†’ Portainer â†’ Deploy â†’ Consul Registration â†’ Live Service
