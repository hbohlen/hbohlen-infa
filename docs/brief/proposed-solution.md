# Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach:**
The hbohlen.io Personal Cloud implements a hub-spoke architecture with a primary gateway VPS managing external access and multiple spoke nodes handling specific services. This creates a resilient, scalable infrastructure that tells a clear "infrastructure story" - from external requests through secure networking to individual service execution.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**
Unlike traditional VPS management or simple hosting platforms, this solution provides:
- **Infrastructure Storytelling:** Visual narratives showing how services interconnect and evolve
- **Learning-Focused Design:** Production patterns implemented with educational transparency
- **Hybrid Development Workflow:** Production-like local development with rapid iteration
- **Domain-Based Service Access:** Clean URLs (falkordb.hbohlen.io, mcp.hbohlen.io/{service}) instead of IP addresses

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
The hub-spoke pattern ensures no single point of failure while maintaining centralized management. Tailscale provides secure mesh networking without complex VPN configuration. The domain-based approach creates professional service access patterns. Most importantly, the infrastructure tells its own story through clear service discovery, automated deployment, and visual monitoring - making it an excellent learning platform for production concepts.

**High-Level Vision:**
Imagine pushing code to your repository and watching as:
1. Your commit triggers automated container builds
2. Services register themselves with the discovery system
3. The reverse proxy automatically routes traffic to the new service
4. Everything becomes accessible at a clean domain name
5. The infrastructure "remembers" this story for future reference and debugging

**Resource and Architecture Approach:**
The solution implements a hub-spoke architecture with Hetzner as the cost-effective primary gateway (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) and service nodes (1-2 vCPU, 2-4GB RAM each), balancing learning opportunities with practical resource allocation. This approach prioritizes educational value (70% focus) while maintaining production reliability (30% focus), using Tailscale for secure networking and domain-based access for professional service presentation.

The solution balances automation with manual learning opportunities, embracing some complexity as an investment in understanding production interworkings through hands-on experience.
