# ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Existing Agent System

### Synergy Opportunities

1. Agents can deploy services - Use existing agent system to trigger deployments
2. Services enhance agents - Hosted databases, APIs, tools for agent consumption
3. Shared configuration - Doppler secrets accessible to both systems
4. Unified documentation - Agent system documents personal cloud services

### Example Integration

# Existing agent deploys new MCP server
agent-dev: "Deploy my new MCP server to personal cloud"
# â†’ Builds container
# â†’ Pushes to infrastructure
# â†’ Registers with Consul
# â†’ Available at mcp.hbohlen.io/new-server
