# hbohlen.io Personal Cloud Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Master production infrastructure patterns through hands-on personal cloud implementation
- Create a reliable, scalable platform for hosting personal development tools and services
- Establish professional-grade infrastructure that demonstrates key production concepts
- Build a learning-focused environment that balances educational value with practical functionality
- Develop portfolio-worthy infrastructure projects for future consulting opportunities
- Reduce infrastructure maintenance time from current manual processes to automated workflows

### Background Context
The hbohlen.io Personal Cloud addresses the critical need for structured personal cloud infrastructure management while learning production-level concepts. Currently, multiple VPS instances (Hetzner primary gateway, Digital Ocean service node) are managed in isolation with manual configuration, ad-hoc service deployment, and inconsistent networking setup. Personal development services like FalkorDB Browser and custom MCP servers are deployed without unified management, creating operational complexity and maintenance overhead.

This solution implements a hub-spoke architecture with a primary gateway managing external access and spoke nodes handling specific services, creating a resilient infrastructure that demonstrates production patterns. The focus is on educational value (70%) while maintaining production reliability (30%), using modern tools like Tailscale for secure networking, Consul for service discovery, and domain-based access for professional service presentation.

```

### Service Architecture
**Hub-Spoke Microservices with Staged Complexity:** The infrastructure implements a distributed microservices pattern that evolves through three phases to prevent cognitive overload while building production-pattern understanding.

**Phase 1:** Simple containerized services with Caddy routing and Tailscale networking
**Phase 2:** Add Portainer orchestration layer for multi-node container management  
**Phase 3:** Introduce Consul service discovery when service count (5+) justifies complexity

**Rationale:** This staged approach balances learning efficiency with production pattern exposure, allowing mastery of core concepts before introducing additional complexity layers.

### Testing Requirements
**Continuous Infrastructure Validation:** Testing strategy emphasizes operational reliability through monitoring-as-testing rather than traditional test pyramid approaches, aligning with infrastructure focus and time constraints.

**Validation Priorities by Phase:**
- **Phase 1:** Network connectivity, SSL certificate automation, basic health checks
- **Phase 2:** Container deployment automation, resource utilization monitoring
- **Phase 3:** Service discovery validation, inter-service communication testing, backup/recovery procedures

**Rationale:** This approach teaches infrastructure reliability patterns while remaining achievable within the 10-15 hour weekly time commitment.

### Technology Introduction Strategy

**Phase 1 Foundation (Months 1-2):**
- **Core Technologies:** Tailscale networking + Caddy reverse proxy
- **Learning Focus:** Secure networking and modern reverse proxy patterns
- **Success Criteria:** Services accessible via *.hbohlen.io with automatic SSL
- **Escape Hatch:** Fall back to traditional nginx + Let's Encrypt if Caddy proves problematic

**Phase 2 Orchestration (Months 3-4):**
- **Add:** Portainer for web-based container management
- **Learning Focus:** Multi-node Docker orchestration and container lifecycle management
- **Success Criteria:** 5+ services deployable and manageable through web interface
- **Migration Path:** Docker Compose → Portainer → (future Kubernetes if needed)

**Phase 3 Service Discovery (Months 5-6):**
- **Add:** Consul for service discovery and health checking
- **Learning Focus:** Production service discovery patterns and distributed system health
- **Success Criteria:** Automatic service registration and health-based routing
- **Alternative:** DNS-based discovery if Consul proves too complex or resource-intensive

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Container Strategy:**
- Docker and Docker Compose for all service definitions and local development
- GitHub Container Registry for image hosting (free tier, integrated with repository)
- Standardized container health checks and resource limits

**Security and Configuration Management:**
- Tailscale mesh networking eliminating complex firewall management
- Caddy automatic SSL/TLS certificate management via Let's Encrypt  
- Docker secrets for sensitive configuration (Phase 1-2), migrating to Consul KV (Phase 3)

**Development and Deployment:**
- GitOps deployment triggered by repository webhooks
- Development environment full replication through Docker Compose
- Infrastructure as Code principles with version-controlled declarative configurations

**Monitoring and Observability Evolution:**
- **Phase 1:** Caddy access logs and Docker container stats
- **Phase 2:** Portainer dashboards and resource monitoring
- **Phase 3:** Consul health checking and custom learning dashboards
- **Future:** Centralized logging approach (details TBD by Architect based on actual usage patterns)

**Data Persistence:**
- PostgreSQL for structured data requirements
- Redis for caching and session management  
- File-based configuration with Git version control integration
- Backup strategy evolution: manual scripts → automated backups → disaster recovery procedures

**Technology Evolution Decision Points:**
- **Add Portainer:** When managing 3+ services becomes unwieldy with Docker Compose alone
- **Add Consul:** When service count reaches 5+ or service-to-service communication requires discovery
- **Consider Kubernetes:** If container orchestration needs exceed Portainer capabilities (likely post-MVP)
- **Upgrade monitoring:** When basic health checks prove insufficient for troubleshooting
